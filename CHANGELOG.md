# Changelog

Only versions published as GitHub Releases are listed as releases. The 2.x milestones below preserve the internal development path that was consolidated into the public 2.4.2 release.

## 2.7.0

- Replaced the pinned engine Kordoc 4.2.5 with Kordoc 4.15.7 and rewrote the build hardening for it (versioned replacement manifest, no COM or filesystem paths, one user-initiated process boundary). Kordoc's optional OCR code is never called and no model is downloaded.
- Import: nested tables, captions, and footnotes are kept; HWP 5 and HWPX produce the same Markdown; PDF two-column text, tables, headings, and footnotes are restored with real page numbers; 24 Korean Adobe CMaps are built in so KSC/UniKS PDFs keep their text. Added a ribbon icon, file-explorer commands for one or many files, drag-and-drop of files and folders, `.hml`, four presets with page range and advanced options, a destination folder setting, password prompts for HWPX (memory only), a shared report with page-numbered warnings and retry buttons, large-file confirmation, and cancellation between files.
- Added a read-only Hangul document viewer for `.hwp` and `.hwpx` in the vault, with convert, compare, form-note, and open-in-default-app actions.
- HWPX: real numbered footnotes and hyperlinks, long tables split across pages with a repeated header row in quick mode too, and deterministic packaging (the same note produces the same bytes).
- Official documents: eight presets (ministry briefing added), institution styles (template library schema 2) with a live preview, note properties with Korean keys and English aliases for cover, approval, heading, closing, notice, and press blocks, an insert-properties button, a non-blocking notation check, a preview, and notices for text the generator removes. Official documents no longer take the table style of the quick HWPX template.
- Official documents map headings and body text properly in all eight types: a note without a `#` title gets its title property or file name, heading levels are made consecutive so draft letters, notices, and minutes number 1. → 가. → 1) instead of one flat run, body paragraphs of those types sit under their heading, the bullet-style report no longer repeats a number written in a heading ("□ 1)"), and report covers show "2026. 9." instead of "2026. 9..".
- Added built-in Hallym University institution styles at the top of the institution style list: Ilsong College of Liberal Arts minutes and meeting materials (Hallym Gothic, • / - items, navy table headers) and the AI Convergence Research Institute interim report (cover with blue and teal rules, 1. → 1) → ○ → - → ·). Hallym fonts appear in the font guide.
- Fixed spaces after bold text disappearing in HWPX previews.
- The eight official-document types now look different from one another: draft letters include the head and foot tables, notices use 15 pt text and end with the date and sender, minutes use 14 pt text at 130 % line spacing, and plans get the policy cover. Notices no longer place the closing date on the left.
- A built-in institution style always makes the document type it was made for; the note's type property no longer overrides it, and the export window says so.
- Official-document properties left blank by "insert properties" no longer produce warnings, type names shown in HanMark's menu (and 공고) are accepted, and an unknown type name is reported instead of being read as a draft letter.
- Official documents are chosen from one form list instead of a type list plus a style list: the Hallym University forms, the eight standard types, and your own forms. A form decides both the type and the look; your own forms now store their document type.
- The HWPX preview has a toolbar: switch between quick HWPX and any official-document form, refresh, and save as HWPX without opening the export window. It opens the way it was last used.
- Official documents print Markdown the same way in every form. Titles that a form draws in a frame (ministry briefing bands, boxes, and contents; band chapters; title boxes) show plain words instead of raw links and marks, link text may contain brackets, `<!-- -->` and `%% %%` comments are left out, bold sub-headings keep their links, report summary boxes print plain text, each line of a quote becomes its own ※ note, and a repeated engine note is reported once with a count.
- Frames no longer overflow. A long title or value that runs slightly past one line is condensed to 95–85 % width; a longer one wraps and its frame grows (ministry briefing bands, boxes, and contents; report and plan titles and chapter bands; bullet-style report frames; the draft letter's head). The plan cover's information labels fit on one line. Documents whose frames already fit are unchanged.
- Note assembly: `![[note]]`, heading, and block embeds are inlined in every export format and the preview, with cycle, depth, and missing-note markers; on by default and can be turned off.
- Toolbar: folds into a slim strip with a pull tab (click the strip, double-click an empty spot, or run the new command; an optional peek shows it while the pointer rests on the strip), keeps each row on one line and moves groups that do not fit into a ⋯ menu, appears in every visible Markdown pane without moving notes when panes change, shows the heading level and pressed text styles at the cursor, remembers the last text and highlight colors, inserts tables from an 8 × 8 grid, folds its formatting row in reading view, and has a minimal look in theme colors.
- Previews: the HWPX preview keeps its picture while it redraws and returns to the same place, has page buttons and zoom, and follows the heading you are editing (it pauses while you scroll the preview); a failed redraw keeps the previous picture under a notice. The DOCX preview keeps its place, zooms, pages the real DOCX, and follows in proportion.
- Status bar: characters with and without spaces and 200-character manuscript sheets (the selection's while text is selected), and the note's official-document form with a menu to change it.
- Empty tabs offer importing a document, a new note, and the files HanMark exported recently.
- Official-document files are named after their form (`무제 - 업무보고.hwpx`; for notes imported from Hangul files, `원본_업무보고_시각.hwpx`) in the note's output language. A note can be exported to several forms at once, each note remembers its last form (also after renaming or moving it), and the HWPX preview now always shows the form it lists.
- Waiting states show a quiet ring or a flowing line, and results arrive with a short check; all motion stops when the system asks for reduced motion.
- Added the old–new comparison table: compare two documents in any importable format and get a note whose identical blocks are aligned first and whose changed words are bold.
- Added form filling: form notes from HWPX click-here fields, label cells, and header-row tables, two built-in standard draft letters, filled copies saved as new files with a report of unmatched properties and values that did not fit.
- Footnotes are shown in HTML and Editorial PDF; documents without footnotes produce the same output as before.
- English interface: follows Obsidian's language and can be fixed in settings. Output labels follow the document's language (English only for notes without Hangul), so Korean notes produce the same documents as before.
- Fonts: HWPX keeps the template's font names on every computer; a font guide lists missing fonts, preview substitutes, and where to get them, and substitutions can be saved per template.
- Notes imported by older versions: the original-format command now always creates a new HWPX from the note instead of patching the original.
- Replaced browser dialogs and silent template-import failures with Obsidian dialogs and notices, explained missing external programs in plain language, and paused slow live previews automatically.
- Fixed: editing a custom HWPX template that has only a table style no longer renames it; the export center shows the active Word template's name instead of its internal ID; Word template options show readable labels (for example "At least" instead of `atLeast`); the insert-link command selects the whole placeholder text.
- Built-in HWPX templates and the built-in PDF theme are shown in the interface language; their stored names are unchanged.
- Dependencies: markdown-it 14.3.2 and patched transitive packages (fast-uri, ip-address, moment) for new security advisories; the runtime and full dependency audits report no vulnerabilities.
- Settings migrate to v12. Command IDs are unchanged; new commands fold the toolbar and export an official document to several forms.

## 2.6.1

- Added direct PDF saving: generate the PDF, then save it as a file; native printing remains a separate action.
- Added single-column, two-column A (full-width figures), and two-column B (column-width figures) journal layouts, with 8/10/12mm column spacing.
- Added independent table width (automatic, one column, full body width). Automatic sizing measures real wrapping at both widths; long tables keep frozen column widths and repeat their headers.
- Added an optional page break before each top-level heading group.
- Settings migrate to v11 with the existing single-column layout and automatic table width as defaults. Kordoc stayed at 4.2.5.

## 2.5.6

- Added an immutable Achmage HanMark PDF theme plus an unlimited Vault-level library of named custom themes with create, duplicate, rename, edit, select, and delete workflows.
- Added a novice-first three-step builder that keeps the saved key-color seed exact and derives semantic print colors with a WCAG `4.5:1` hard gate. Automatic text may use a text-bearing key surface within `ΔEOK <= 0.02`; an unsafe adjustment or one beyond that product cap falls back to the exact surface and its safe foreground.
- Added three advanced manual color overrides with live contrast ratios and non-blocking warnings. A manual key-background text color disables the automatic surface correction and uses the exact key surface; cover/page furniture remains editable or blank and the active theme remains persistent.
- Added strict single-theme JSON import/export through the existing user-initiated file gateway without new network, clipboard, filesystem, process, or runtime dependency capabilities.
- Preserved the exact 2.5.5 built-in PDF output, print lifecycle, Markdown source, HWPX, DOCX, HTML, import, and existing command behavior.

## 2.5.5

- Made the first Editorial PDF export after a fresh Obsidian launch deterministic by waiting for the attached print stylesheet, embedded Pretendard weights, images, and stable print layout before opening the native print dialog.
- Added a directly discoverable PDF button to the top HanMark toolbar. It opens the unified export center with PDF selected and preserves the existing `export-pdf` command.
- Kept the 2.5.4 theme-independent Editorial palette, full-bleed cover, headers, footers, page numbering, large-document safeguards, and all HWPX, DOCX, HTML, import, and template behavior unchanged.

## 2.5.4

- Isolated the built-in Editorial PDF from Obsidian's light and dark themes by establishing a fixed light print color scheme and a complete scoped paper, body, navy, teal, border, code, and highlight palette.
- Fixed semantic leaf elements—including emphasis, links, list markers, inline code, tables, callouts, decorations, and images—so inherited theme colors, filters, and opacity cannot leak into the printed result.
- Normalized explicit inline text and background colors to the Editorial PDF palette for deterministic output across themes and computers; supported HTML colors and all HWPX/DOCX behavior remain unchanged.
- Preserved 2.5.3 large-code splitting, adaptive table pagination, safe deep-structure handling, native print lifecycle protection, full-bleed cover, page furniture, and imported BMP rendering.
- Preserved the Markdown source, Kordoc 4.2.5 HWPX generation, templates, optional Pandoc DOCX path, imports, CMDS Eagle bridge, and existing command IDs.

## 2.5.3

- Hardened the built-in Editorial PDF path for large code blocks, multi-page and very wide tables, oversized quotes and callouts, image-heavy containers, long prose, nested lists, and deeply nested structures.
- Physically divided oversized code into bounded print chunks while preserving the exact source text and line endings.
- Kept ordinary multi-page tables as native repeating-header tables, while moving exceptionally tall rows or headers and very wide tables to an ordinary-flow vertical fallback that preserves cell order, complete values, and images.
- Kept the Obsidian print document visible and mounted through native Save-as-PDF handling, waited for layout to settle, rejected concurrent print requests safely, and swept stale HanMark print state before a new export.
- Added bounded, privacy-safe stage diagnostics so failures identify the PDF step without exposing note text, local paths, image payloads, or private cause messages.
- Refined the deterministic Editorial layout with a full-bleed HanMark cover, branded headers, precisely spaced teal rules, one-column body pages, and actual page numbers.
- Rendered signature-validated BMP data images imported from HWPX as actual images in Achmage Editorial HTML instead of literal Markdown or base64 text.
- Preserved the Markdown source, Kordoc 4.2.5 HWPX generation, templates, optional Pandoc DOCX path, imports, CMDS Eagle bridge, and existing command IDs.

## 2.5.2

- Added a shared semantic Editorial document model for Achmage Editorial HTML and PDF, normalizing soft line breaks while preserving headings, nested lists, tasks, tables, quotes, callouts, code, links, wiki links, and images.
- Normalized supported raw HTML into safe elements and removed scripts, event handlers, unsafe URLs, and unsupported subtrees; the selectable Classic HTML theme retains its previous compatibility behavior.
- Replaced generic Obsidian PDF delegation with a built-in Chromium Editorial print pipeline: an A4 filename-only cover followed by a filename header, top and bottom rules, and actual page numbers.
- Made PDF image preparation fail closed with retry or cancellation, kept the Markdown source unchanged, and left Pandoc outside the PDF path.
- Embedded Pretendard 400 and 600 in `styles.css` under the SIL Open Font License 1.1, adding roughly 2 MB while removing the need for a separately installed PDF font.
- Launched Windows Explorer as a visible non-blocking Show-in-folder handoff with the saved file selected, without weakening converter exit-code or timeout handling.
- Added a configurable Vault-relative imported-image folder, skipped unreferenced extracted images, and cleaned only verified HanMark-owned temporary copies after successful CMDS cloud replacement.
- Preserved Kordoc 4.2.5 HWPX generation, templates, optional Pandoc DOCX, document import, CMDS Eagle and optional R2 image paths, toolbar editing, and existing command IDs.
- Raised the minimum desktop Obsidian version to 1.8.9 for the required Chromium print capabilities.

## 2.5.1

- Replaced truncating Markdown image regular expressions with a shared iterative scanner that supports Korean, percent-encoded spaces, angle destinations, escaped characters, and balanced parentheses.
- Kept imported Vault images available to HWPX live preview and HWPX, DOCX, and HTML export; new local imports use unambiguous Vault-root wiki embeds.
- Added Vault, CMDS Eagle's active cloud provider, and ask-every-import image destinations, with an optional direct R2 fallback.
- Added a credential-free CMDS Eagle workspace-event contract and a verified compatibility bridge through `cmds-eagle:convert-all-to-cloud`; HanMark never reads CMDS Eagle private settings or credentials.
- Added an optional HTTPS R2 Worker fallback. Worker/Public URLs are user configured, while the API key remains in memory for the current Obsidian session and is never persisted.
- Removed giant image-string spreading and full-payload regular-expression captures from the standalone HTML renderer, preventing Electron-dependent `Maximum call stack size exceeded` failures.
- Accepted Windows Explorer's handoff exit code only for the fixed Show-in-folder launcher while preserving strict exit handling for every other process.
- Preserved Kordoc 4.2.5 HWPX generation, templates, Achmage Editorial and Classic HTML, optional Pandoc DOCX, PDF delegation, toolbar editing, and existing command IDs.

## 2.5.0

- Added **Achmage Editorial** as the default HTML export theme while preserving the previous output as the selectable **Classic** compatibility theme.
- Added a deterministic editorial masthead, heading bars, callouts, tables, responsive media and code, narrow-screen rules, and dedicated A4 print styling.
- Promoted the first leading H1 to the masthead and removed that one duplicate heading from the article body; the note title remains the fallback.
- Embedded validated local and remote PNG, JPEG, GIF, and BMP images as data URIs so completed HTML files remain self-contained and usable offline.
- Kept the existing `${title}_html.html` output naming and reported image failures through retry, explicit missing-image continuation, or cancellation instead of silently retaining external sources.
- Added a strict Content Security Policy and URL allowlists. Generated HTML contains no JavaScript, event handlers, CDN, external stylesheet, bundled font, iframe, or arbitrary user CSS.
- Added Kami MIT attribution for the adapted document-design language without bundling the Kami package, font assets, build scripts, or example content.
- Preserved HWPX, DOCX, PDF, import, template, toolbar, DOCX preview, legacy command compatibility, and the user-initiated Pandoc boundary from 2.4.5.

## 2.4.5

- Made an explicit Fast DOCX Preview open render the semantic document immediately and upgrade it exactly once to the actual Pandoc-generated package.
- Kept Pandoc outside workspace restoration and view lifecycle events. Typing marks the result as changed, while active-document and template changes refresh only the in-process semantic preview.
- Fitted actual DOCX pages to the available pane without changing page proportions or pagination, with bounded scaling and horizontal overflow for very narrow panes.
- Changed new HWP, HWPX, PDF, DOCX, XLSX, and XLS imports to ordinary Markdown body content and rewritten Vault attachment links, without generated source YAML, source callouts, or round-trip source caching.
- Removed source patching from the public export types and export center while preserving the non-overwriting compatibility path as a command-palette-only legacy command for older imported notes.
- Added a safe migration command that creates a clean Markdown sibling from older HanMark-generated source metadata while preserving user-authored YAML and ordinary callouts.
- Removed an unnecessary `FontFaceSet` type assertion reported by Community review without changing font loading behavior.
- Preserved HWPX generation, embedded images, templates, toolbar editing, DOCX/HTML/PDF export, existing command IDs, and the optional Pandoc workflow.

## 2.4.4

- Fixed Pandoc DOCX export and actual-package preview by removing leading Obsidian YAML frontmatter and the generated source callout before Markdown line normalization.
- Added BOM/CRLF-safe frontmatter parsing, preserved YAML examples inside fenced code, and reported an actionable error for an unclosed leading frontmatter block.
- Replaced the tabbed/scrolling export form with one responsive 2×2 HWPX, DOCX, HTML, and PDF format grid using the active toolbar palette.
- Delegated PDF to Obsidian's native PDF export command and clearly separated its print-style output from HanMark HWPX and Word templates.
- Kept completed Vault exports visible with their result path and added an explicit-click **Show in folder** action for newly written Vault files.
- Preserved existing command IDs, template systems, Kordoc 4.2.5 HWPX behavior, optional Pandoc DOCX behavior, and the 2.4.3 Community review safeguards.

## 2.4.3

- Preserved the 2.4.2 HWPX, image, template, toolbar, HTML, and optional Pandoc DOCX behavior while replacing the untyped legacy compatibility runtime with typed modules.
- Moved user-selected imports, Vault writes, export saves, and source-round-trip caching to Obsidian and browser file APIs; retained the `hwp-source-*` contract and added optional `hwp-source-cache`.
- Removed runtime dynamic code evaluation, clipboard access, direct Node filesystem access, and CSS forced-priority declarations.
- Enabled the complete Obsidian/TypeScript safety rule set and added a release-blocking Community review gate.
- Overrode vulnerable optional transitive versions while continuing to exclude OCR/ML and native Kordoc extras from installation and the startup bundle.
- Updated GitHub Actions to Node 24 action runtimes and added Windows/macOS verification, runtime dependency auditing, exact three-file Release publishing, and artifact attestations.
- Kept user-initiated Pandoc DOCX export/preview and Windows Word-to-PDF preview as the sole disclosed shell capability.
- Retained the searchable installed/custom Word font catalog through explicit browser file selection and a private font cache; legacy 2.4.2 preview-font paths may require one re-selection.
- Restored rendering of the actual Pandoc-generated DOCX package while preventing view-open, typing, active-note, and template lifecycle events from starting an executable.
- Restored the resizable three-pane Word template editor, dirty-change guard, style links, toolbar palettes, native color pickers, checklist/callout/script controls, and live HWPX preview switch.

## 2.4.2

- Pinned the built-in HWPX engine to Kordoc 4.2.5.
- Routed every HWPX creation command away from the retired Python/pypandoc-hwpx workflow.
- Embedded remote, data-URI, and Vault images into generated HWPX packages with explicit failure handling.
- Added semantic body and Heading 1–6 typography, paragraph, page, and table profiles.
- Added unlimited user templates with import, create, duplicate, rename, edit, select, and delete operations.
- Added a cached, debounced Kordoc SVG preview and resizable export/template dialogs.
- Added HWP/HWPX source patching without overwriting the original file.
- Added the official Obsidian ESLint rules, release consistency checks, dependency overrides, and Windows/macOS CI.

## 한국어 개발 기록

GitHub Release로 공개된 버전만 정식 릴리스로 표시합니다. 아래 2.x 이력은 공개 2.4.2에 통합된 내부 개발 흐름을 보존하기 위한 기록입니다.

### 2.5.6

- 수정 불가능한 Achmage HanMark PDF 기본 테마와 생성·복제·이름 변경·편집·선택·삭제가 가능한 Vault 단위 다중 사용자 테마 라이브러리를 추가했습니다.
- 저장되는 키 컬러 seed는 그대로 유지하면서 WCAG `4.5:1`을 하드 게이트로 의미 기반 인쇄 색을 파생하는 초보자용 3단계 빌더를 추가했습니다. 자동 글자는 `ΔEOK <= 0.02`인 글자용 키 면만 사용할 수 있고, 안전하거나 충분히 가까운 면을 만들 수 없으면 원래 면과 안전한 글자색으로 돌아갑니다.
- 실제 대비와 비차단 경고를 제공하는 고급 수동 색상 3개를 추가했습니다. 키 배경 위 글자를 직접 지정하면 면 자동 보정이 꺼지고 원래 키 면을 사용합니다. 비울 수 있는 표지·페이지 문구와 활성 테마 기억도 함께 추가했습니다.
- 기존 사용자 명시 파일 게이트웨이를 이용한 엄격한 단일 테마 JSON 가져오기·내보내기를 추가하며 네트워크·클립보드·파일시스템·프로세스·런타임 의존 권한을 늘리지 않았습니다.
- 2.5.5 내장 PDF 출력, 인쇄 수명주기, Markdown 원문, HWPX·DOCX·HTML·가져오기와 기존 명령 동작을 그대로 보존했습니다.

### 2.5.5

- Obsidian을 새로 실행한 뒤 최초 Editorial PDF를 내보낼 때도 연결된 인쇄 스타일시트, 내장 Pretendard 굵기, 이미지와 인쇄 조판이 안정될 때까지 기다린 뒤 네이티브 인쇄 창을 열도록 해 결과를 결정론적으로 만들었습니다.
- 상단 HanMark 툴바에 PDF 버튼을 추가했습니다. 통합 내보내기 센터를 PDF가 선택된 상태로 열며 기존 `export-pdf` 명령도 유지합니다.
- 2.5.4의 테마 독립형 Editorial 팔레트, 전면 표지, 머리말·꼬리말, 쪽 번호, 대형 문서 보호와 HWPX·DOCX·HTML·가져오기·템플릿 동작은 그대로 유지합니다.

### 2.5.4

- 내장 Editorial PDF에 고정된 라이트 인쇄 색상 체계와 지면·본문·남색·청록색·테두리·코드·강조색 팔레트를 설정해 Obsidian 라이트·다크 테마로부터 격리했습니다.
- 강조·링크·목록 기호·인라인 코드·표·콜아웃·장식·이미지 등 말단 의미 요소에 색상 규칙을 고정해 테마의 상속 색상, 필터와 투명도가 인쇄 결과에 섞이지 않게 했습니다.
- 명시적인 인라인 글자색과 배경색을 Editorial PDF 표준 팔레트로 정규화해 테마와 컴퓨터가 달라도 결정론적인 PDF를 만듭니다. HTML에서 지원하던 색상과 HWPX·DOCX 동작은 그대로 유지합니다.
- 2.5.3의 대형 코드 분할, 표 자동 배치, 깊은 구조 안전 처리, 네이티브 인쇄 수명주기 보호, 전면 표지·본문 지면과 가져온 BMP 렌더링을 유지합니다.
- Markdown 원문, Kordoc 4.2.5 HWPX 생성, 템플릿, 선택형 Pandoc DOCX 경로, 가져오기, CMDS Eagle 브리지와 기존 명령 ID를 유지합니다.

### 2.5.3

- 대형 코드 블록, 여러 페이지·초광폭 표, 큰 인용·콜아웃, 이미지가 많은 컨테이너, 장문, 중첩 목록과 깊은 구조에서도 내장 Editorial PDF가 안전하게 조판되도록 보강했습니다.
- 매우 큰 코드 블록을 제한된 크기의 인쇄 청크로 물리적으로 나누면서 원래 코드 문자열과 줄바꿈을 정확히 보존합니다.
- 일반적인 여러 페이지 표는 머리글이 반복되는 실제 표로 유지하고, 지나치게 높은 행·머리글과 매우 넓은 표는 셀 순서·전체 값·이미지를 보존하는 일반 흐름의 세로형 대체 배치로 전환합니다.
- Obsidian 인쇄 문서를 네이티브 PDF 저장 단계까지 보이게 유지하고 조판 안정화를 기다리며, 중복 인쇄 요청은 안전하게 거절하고 다음 내보내기 전에 남은 HanMark 인쇄 상태를 정리합니다.
- PDF 실패 단계를 알려 주면서도 노트 본문, 로컬 경로, 이미지 payload와 비공개 원인 메시지는 노출하지 않는 범위 제한 진단을 추가했습니다.
- 전면 HanMark 표지, 브랜드 머리말, 정밀한 청록색 실선, 1단 본문과 실제 쪽 번호를 갖춘 결정론적 Editorial 배치를 다듬었습니다.
- HWPX에서 가져온 서명 검증 BMP data 이미지가 Achmage Editorial HTML에서 Markdown 또는 base64 글자가 아니라 실제 이미지로 렌더링되도록 수정했습니다.
- Markdown 원문, Kordoc 4.2.5 HWPX 생성, 템플릿, 선택형 Pandoc DOCX 경로, 가져오기, CMDS Eagle 브리지와 기존 명령 ID는 유지합니다.

### 2.5.2

- Achmage Editorial HTML과 PDF가 제목·중첩 목록·할 일·표·인용·콜아웃·코드·링크·위키 링크·이미지를 공유하는 의미 구조를 사용하게 하고 소프트 줄바꿈을 정규화했습니다.
- 지원하는 원시 HTML을 안전한 요소로 정규화하고 스크립트·이벤트 핸들러·안전하지 않은 URL과 지원하지 않는 하위 구조를 제거했습니다. Classic HTML 테마의 이전 호환 동작은 유지합니다.
- 일반 Obsidian PDF 위임을 내장 Chromium Editorial 인쇄 파이프라인으로 교체해 A4 파일명 전용 표지와 2쪽 이후 파일명 머리말·위아래 실선·실제 쪽 번호를 제공합니다.
- PDF 이미지 준비를 재시도 또는 취소만 가능한 실패 폐쇄 방식으로 바꾸고, Markdown 원문을 변경하지 않으며 PDF 경로에서 Pandoc을 사용하지 않습니다.
- SIL Open Font License 1.1에 따라 Pretendard 400·600을 `styles.css`에 포함했습니다. 용량은 약 2 MB 늘지만 PDF 글꼴을 따로 설치할 필요가 없습니다.
- Windows Explorer를 보이는 비차단 방식으로 실행해 저장 파일을 선택하되, 변환기 종료코드와 시간 제한 판정은 약화하지 않았습니다.
- 가져온 이미지용 Vault 상대 폴더를 지정할 수 있게 하고, 본문에서 참조하지 않는 추출 이미지는 저장하지 않으며, CMDS 클라우드 교체 성공 뒤 검증된 HanMark 소유 임시 사본만 정리합니다.
- Kordoc 4.2.5 HWPX 생성·템플릿, 선택적 Pandoc DOCX, 문서 가져오기, CMDS Eagle·선택형 R2 이미지 경로, 툴바 편집과 기존 명령 ID를 보존했습니다.
- 필요한 Chromium 인쇄 기능을 위해 데스크톱 Obsidian 최소 버전을 1.8.9로 올렸습니다.

### 2.5.1

- 이미지 Markdown 정규식을 공통 반복형 스캐너로 교체해 한글, `%20` 공백, 꺾쇠 목적지, 이스케이프 문자와 균형 괄호가 섞인 경로를 끝까지 보존합니다.
- 불러온 Vault 이미지를 HWPX 라이브 미리보기와 HWPX·DOCX·HTML 내보내기에서 계속 사용할 수 있게 했고, 새 로컬 가져오기는 모호하지 않은 Vault 루트 위키 임베드를 사용합니다.
- 가져온 이미지 저장 방식을 Vault, CMDS Eagle 현재 클라우드, 매번 묻기 중에서 선택할 수 있게 하고 선택적 직접 R2 폴백을 추가했습니다.
- 자격증명을 공유하지 않는 CMDS Eagle 워크스페이스 이벤트 계약과 `cmds-eagle:convert-all-to-cloud` 등록 명령을 통한 검증형 호환 브리지를 추가했습니다. HanMark는 CMDS Eagle의 비공개 설정이나 자격증명을 읽지 않습니다.
- 선택적 HTTPS R2 Worker 폴백을 추가했습니다. Worker/Public URL만 사용자가 설정하며 API 키는 현재 Obsidian 세션의 메모리에만 두고 저장하지 않습니다.
- 독립형 HTML 렌더러에서 거대한 이미지 문자열 펼치기와 전체 payload 정규식 캡처를 제거해 Electron 환경의 `Maximum call stack size exceeded` 오류를 막았습니다.
- Windows Explorer의 전달 완료 종료코드만 고정된 파일 위치 보기 실행기에 한해 허용하고 다른 프로세스의 종료 판정은 그대로 엄격하게 유지했습니다.
- Kordoc 4.2.5 HWPX 생성, 템플릿, Achmage Editorial·Classic HTML, 선택적 Pandoc DOCX, PDF 위임, 툴바 편집과 기존 명령 ID를 보존했습니다.

### 2.5.0

- HTML 내보내기의 기본 테마로 **Achmage Editorial**을 추가하고, 이전 출력 외형은 선택 가능한 **Classic** 호환 테마로 보존했습니다.
- 편집 디자인 마스트헤드, 제목 막대, 콜아웃, 표, 반응형 이미지·코드, 좁은 화면 규칙과 A4 전용 인쇄 스타일을 추가했습니다.
- 맨 앞 첫 H1을 마스트헤드로 옮겨 본문에서는 한 번만 제거하고, 해당 H1이 없으면 노트 제목을 사용합니다.
- 검증된 로컬·원격 PNG·JPEG·GIF·BMP 이미지를 data URI로 포함해 완성된 HTML이 독립형으로 오프라인에서 열리게 했습니다.
- 기존 `${title}_html.html` 파일명을 유지하고, 외부 이미지 주소를 조용히 남기는 대신 재시도·명시적인 누락 표시로 계속·취소 절차로 실패를 알립니다.
- 엄격한 Content Security Policy와 URL 허용 목록을 추가했습니다. 생성 HTML에는 JavaScript, 이벤트 핸들러, CDN, 외부 스타일시트, 내장 글꼴, iframe과 임의 사용자 CSS가 없습니다.
- Kami 패키지·글꼴·빌드 스크립트·예제 콘텐츠를 포함하지 않으면서 응용한 문서 디자인 언어에 MIT 저작자 표시를 추가했습니다.
- 2.4.5의 HWPX·DOCX·PDF·가져오기·템플릿·툴바·DOCX 미리보기·레거시 명령 호환과 사용자 요청 기반 Pandoc 경계를 유지했습니다.

### 2.4.5

- 사용자가 빠른 DOCX 미리보기를 직접 열면 간이 문서를 즉시 표시한 뒤 Pandoc이 생성한 실제 패키지로 정확히 한 번 전환하도록 했습니다.
- 작업공간 복원과 뷰 생명주기 이벤트에서는 Pandoc을 실행하지 않습니다. 입력은 기존 결과를 `변경됨`으로 표시하고, 활성 문서와 템플릿 변경은 프로세스 없는 간이 미리보기만 갱신합니다.
- 실제 DOCX 페이지의 비율과 페이지 구분을 바꾸지 않으면서 패널 폭에 맞추고, 아주 좁은 패널에서는 제한된 축척과 가로 스크롤을 사용합니다.
- 새 HWP·HWPX·PDF·DOCX·XLSX·XLS 가져오기는 생성된 원본 YAML·원본 콜아웃·왕복 원본 캐시 없이 일반 Markdown 본문과 실제 Vault 첨부 링크만 만듭니다.
- 공개 내보내기 타입과 내보내기 센터에서 원본 수정을 제거하고, 예전 가져오기 노트를 위한 비덮어쓰기 호환 경로만 명령 팔레트 전용 레거시 명령으로 유지했습니다.
- 사용자가 작성한 YAML과 일반 콜아웃을 보존하면서 예전 HanMark 생성 원본 메타데이터만 제거한 깨끗한 Markdown 형제 노트를 만드는 안전한 마이그레이션 명령을 추가했습니다.
- 글꼴 로딩 동작을 바꾸지 않으면서 Community 심사에서 지적한 불필요한 `FontFaceSet` 타입 단언을 제거했습니다.
- HWPX 생성, 이미지 포함, 템플릿, 툴바 편집, DOCX·HTML·PDF 내보내기, 기존 명령 ID와 선택적 Pandoc 절차를 유지했습니다.

### 2.4.4

- Markdown 줄 정규화 전에 Obsidian YAML 프런트매터와 생성된 원본 안내 콜아웃을 제거해 Pandoc DOCX 내보내기와 실제 패키지 미리보기를 복구했습니다.
- BOM·CRLF에 안전한 프런트매터 처리를 추가하고 코드 펜스 안의 YAML 예제를 보존하며, 닫히지 않은 선두 프런트매터에는 해결 방법이 포함된 오류를 표시합니다.
- 탭과 긴 스크롤 방식의 내보내기 화면을 현재 툴바 팔레트를 따르는 반응형 2×2 HWPX·DOCX·HTML·PDF 형식 그리드로 교체했습니다.
- PDF를 Obsidian 기본 PDF 내보내기 명령에 위임하고, 해당 인쇄 스타일 결과가 HanMark HWPX·Word 템플릿 변환이 아님을 명확히 했습니다.
- 완료된 Vault 내보내기의 결과 경로를 창에 유지하고, 방금 저장한 Vault 파일에 한해 사용자가 직접 누르는 **파일 위치 보기**를 추가했습니다.
- 기존 명령 ID, 템플릿 시스템, Kordoc 4.2.5 HWPX 동작, 선택적 Pandoc DOCX와 2.4.3 Community 심사 안전장치를 유지했습니다.

### 2.4.3

- 2.4.2의 HWPX·이미지·템플릿·툴바·HTML·선택적 Pandoc DOCX 동작을 유지하면서 타입이 없던 구 호환 런타임을 타입 모듈로 교체했습니다.
- 사용자 선택 파일, Vault 저장, 결과 파일 저장과 원본 왕복 캐시를 Obsidian·브라우저 파일 API로 옮겼습니다. `hwp-source-*` 계약을 유지하고 선택적인 `hwp-source-cache`를 추가했습니다.
- 런타임 동적 코드 실행, 클립보드 접근, Node 파일 시스템 직접 접근과 CSS 강제 우선순위를 제거했습니다.
- Obsidian·TypeScript 안전 규칙 전체와 Release 차단형 Community 심사 게이트를 활성화했습니다.
- 취약한 선택적 전이 의존성 버전을 안전하게 고정하면서 OCR·ML·Kordoc 네이티브 선택 모듈은 설치와 시작 번들에서 계속 제외했습니다.
- GitHub Actions 자체 런타임을 Node 24 계열로 갱신하고 Windows·macOS 검증, 배포 의존성 감사, 정확한 세 파일 Release 발행과 artifact attestation을 추가했습니다.
- 사용자가 직접 실행하는 Pandoc DOCX 내보내기·미리보기와 Windows Word-to-PDF 미리보기만 명시적인 셸 기능으로 유지했습니다.
- 설치·사용자 Word 글꼴 검색을 명시적인 브라우저 파일 선택과 비공개 글꼴 캐시로 유지했습니다. 2.4.2에서 경로로 등록한 미리보기 글꼴은 한 번 다시 선택해야 할 수 있습니다.
- 뷰 열기·입력·활성 노트·템플릿 변경이 실행 파일을 시작하지 않도록 막으면서 Pandoc이 실제로 만든 DOCX 패키지 렌더링을 복원했습니다.
- 크기 조절 가능한 3단 Word 템플릿 편집기, 미저장 변경 보호, 스타일 연결, 툴바 팔레트, 네이티브 색상 선택기, 체크·콜아웃·첨자 도구와 실시간 HWPX 미리보기 스위치를 복원했습니다.

- **2.0.x:** Kordoc을 기본 Markdown-to-HWPX 엔진으로 전환하고 패키지 검증을 도입했습니다.
- **2.1.x:** Obsidian Markdown 어댑터, 공문서 프리셋, 문서 가져오기, 원본 수정과 빠른 미리보기를 개발했습니다.
- **2.2.x:** 글꼴·이름 스타일·문단·페이지·표 프로필 생성을 개발하고 밑줄 및 한컴 스타일 ID 호환 문제를 수정했습니다.
- **2.3.x:** 원격·Vault 이미지 포함, 첨부 이미지 추출, HWPX 템플릿 가져오기와 초기 사용자 템플릿 절차를 개발했습니다.
- **2.4.0–2.4.1:** 단일 템플릿 슬롯을 다중 라이브러리로 바꾸고 한글 F6 단위에 문단 편집기를 맞추며 내보내기·템플릿 창을 확대했습니다.
- **2.4.2:** Kordoc 4.2.5로 업데이트하고 첫 공개 2.x 버전을 위한 Community 자동심사 대응을 완료했습니다.
